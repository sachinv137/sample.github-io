            detail: 'Before you proceed with the recipe, pluck methi leaves. Rinse them well in water and then finely chop them. Usually I get one or two bunches from the market. Pluck the leaves and keep them in an airtight box in the fridge. The leaves stay good for about 10 days. Then I just rinse them, chop them and add to the dish. Its more easy this way and takes less time to make any recipe with methi. Chop the methi leaves. Sprinkle some salt on them. Mix well and allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Then squeeze the methi leaves with your hands and then add in the recipe. This way much bitterness can be removed from methi leaves.'

            detail: 'I had got some requests to post kaju khoya. A friend had shared kaju khoya recipe with me earlier. So I tried her recipe with some variations. This version is like some gravies you get in restaurants. But the gravy is not thick or creamy. The kaju khoya curry is subtly flavored and spiced. Since this is a rich curry, its good to make on special occasions, festivals or celebrations. Few more similar delicious recipes. Khoya kaju gravy goes best with tandoori rotis, naans or chapatis. This khoya kaju gravy also goes with steamed rice, jeera rice or vegetable pulao. '

            detail: 'Stir well so that the spice powder or masala mixes evenly with the rest of the mixture. Keep the flame low as you don’t want the spices to get burnt. You can also switch off the flame, while adding the spices powders, so that they don’t get burnt. Stir and saute till you see fat releasing the sides of the masala mixture. About 2 minutes on a low flame. Add ¾ cup water and stir very well. You can also add water as per the consistency you want. For a thicker consistency, add less water. I kept a medium consistency gravy. '

Onions, tomatoes, cashews and spices make this a rich, flavorful and delicious recipe. This vegetarian Paneer Lababdar recipe is also naturally gluten-free. '

            detail: 'First rinse 250 grams okra (ladies finger) very well in running water a few times. Then drain them completely in a strainer or colander. Wipe each okra with a kitchen napkin. There should be no moisture on them. You can also allow them to dry naturally at room temperature, by spreading them on a large plate or tray'

            detail: 'Grind to a fine consistency. Don’t make a coarse powder as the masala then comes in the mouth while eating. Remove the kadai masala and keep aside. The cashews will release fat while grinding, but just scrape the masala from the sides and continue to grind again. Substitutes for cashews are 6 to 7 almonds or ½ tbsp melon seeds (magaz). With almonds and melon seeds, the taste of the gravy will slightly change.'

            detail: 'First we need to roast some spices and then grind them. The spices are 7 to 8 dry Kashmiri chilies or byadagi chilies, 1.5 tbsp coriander seeds, 2 tsp poppy seeds and ½ tsp cumin seeds. If using any other variety than use chilies which are less in heat. Heat a pan. Add the spices and on a low flame, lightly roast them till they are fragrant. No need to brown them. Allow these spices to cool.'
